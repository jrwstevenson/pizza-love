# Pizza Love

[View demo here](https://pizza-love.james-stevenson.com/)

This is a small project built to help people show their love for Pizza.

I have used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
and
[Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) (üëàüèº My new favorite library).

No redux needed for a project of this scale when the [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) is more than capable.
